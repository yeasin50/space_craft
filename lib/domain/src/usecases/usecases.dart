// usecase package contains all the use case implementations of our application.
// These are also called “application-specific business rules”. By just checking this package, 
//you can understand what the app is doing. A use case class has just one method called something 
//like invoke or run, and it performs only what class name says based on the single-responsibility principle
//. For instance, we may have use cases such as GetUser or SetUserName,
// and we can utilize these for our profile feature that we mentioned before.
