## ⚠ For game you should use [Flame package](https://pub.dev/packages/flame)

<!-- ## ⚠ Debuging is Much laggy, avoid debug statements on forEach loop -->

Thought It might be because we are changing a lot, but sometimes it's just happen because of print/debug statements.  
Now lets add Explosions Rives on it, Not sure about how it gonna perform.
