# SpaceCraft

A simple game, wanna implement in flutter.

## Over Engineered; This is my play ground 😅

[Audio manager using assets_audio_player](https://pub.dev/packages/assets_audio_player/example)

## TODO
- [ ] check [just_audio_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio_windows/)
- [ ] format constructor style based on flutter; Constructor then variables
- [ ] Improve performance by testing on profile mode
- [ ] keyboard movement works after tapping
- [ ] score based on EnemyShip
- [x] controls space on enemy generation
- [ ] create two shape for player collision
- [ ] control generationRate
- [ ] bullet rotate effect
- [ ] replace `Positioned` with `Align` widget
- [ ] rm unused assets

## ⚠ For game you should use [Flame package](https://pub.dev/packages/flame)

<!-- ## ⚠ Debugging is Much laggy, avoid debug statements on forEach loop -->

Thought It might be because we are changing a lot, but sometimes it's just happen because of print/debug statements.  
Now lets add Explosions Rives on it, Not sure about how it gonna perform.
